'''
Multimodal machine learning for physiological signals.
Session-consistent: one feature vector per window (e.g., 30–60 s)
Modality-aware: ECG ≠ PPG ≠ Bioimp
Robust to missing modalities
Low leakage risk (no direct use of labels like GLC in features)
Compatible with tabular ML + deep learning

Important:
If you have multiple files with the SAME modality
(e.g., two ECG files): Only the LAST one is kept—previous ones are overwritten.
